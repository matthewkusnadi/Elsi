            I know we haven't known each other for long, but for me it seems like we've known each other our whole lives. I thank God constantly for you as you are the most precious thing to me. <br>
            I promise to take care of you every day, shower you with love and gifts (in the future im a broke ahh rn) and always be there for you when you need.
            I pray that we can keep constantly growing closer to God and make an impact to those around us. <br> 
            Thank you for being patient with me and being understanding as I am always constantly learning. I know this year hasn't been the best for both of us but im glad I get to do it with you and I wouldn't change anything for it. I'd do it again and again if its with you. I love you so much and I hope we'll be able to make memories this coming year together, have great laughs and moments and most importantly learn to love each other more.ðŸ’˜
